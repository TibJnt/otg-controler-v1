Analyze this screenshot from a short-form video app (like TikTok).

Describe what you see in the video content and identify key topics/themes.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "caption": "A brief 1-2 sentence description of the video content",
  "topics": ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"],
  "contentType": "dance|comedy|tutorial|music|food|fitness|fashion|gaming|pets|nature|other",
  "hasText": true/false,
  "textContent": "any visible text in the video (empty string if none)"
}

Focus on identifying:
- What activity or content is shown (dancing, cooking, talking, etc.)
- People characteristics if relevant (but keep it general)
- The mood or style of the content
- Any visible hashtags or text overlays

Keep topics as single lowercase words when possible (e.g., "dance", "girl", "music", "funny", "cooking").
